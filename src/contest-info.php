<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Contests will mostly follow
<a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/contests/acm-icpc-rules-summary.html">classical ICPC rules</a>,
in particular:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each contest typically lasts 5 hours.</li>
  <li>Ranking of teams is based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Number of problems solved;</li>
      <li>In case of a tie, total time for all accepted problems;</li>
      <li>Each rejected submission for an accepted problem adds 20 minutes penalty time;</li>
      <li>If there is still a tie, the time of acceptance for the last problem;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It is possible to ask for clarifications about the problem in case of possible ambiguity
    or error. The answers will typically be restricted to “Yes”, “No” or “No comments”;</li>
  <li>The scoreboard is public and updated during the contest, except for the last hour, during
    which it will be frozen.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We follow the "1pc" rule: in a team, <b>only one person is allowed to use a computer at any
    given point in time.</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>For onsite participants, this means that a team will only have access to one computer
    during a contest.</li>
  <li>Online participants may use different computers (e.g. when the members of a team are not
    participating in the same room). We rely on your honesty to keep track and make sure that
    only one person is using a computer at any given time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Using the Internet during a contest is not forbidden. <b>However, if your team is preparing for
    ICPC or a similar contest, it is heavily discouraged; we recommend using an ICPC-compliant Team
    Reference Document instead.</b> Communicating with other people or large language models (e.g.
  talking to other people about the problems, asking questions on stackoverflow or similar forums,
  prompting ChatGPT) is forbidden.
</p>
<p>
  Terms and conditions of <a href="/legal.php">the camp</a> and
  <a href="https://support.eolymp.com/policies/terms">the contest system</a> apply.
</p>

<h3>Contest environment</h3>

<p>
  Our contests will be hosted on <a href="https://www.eolymp.com/en/">eolymp</a>. More detailed
  information about the system, such as compilation/execution lines and example solutions can be
  found <a href="https://www.eolymp.com/en/help/">here</a>. Participants will receive
  credentials by email.
</p>

<h3>Onsite rules</h3>
<p>
  Onsite teams will be given access to computers in the host university. You will be provided a
  VirtualBox virtual machine running Xubuntu 22.04. Within the virtual machine you have sudo
  permissions and you are allowed to do anything you want to it. Several common editors, IDEs
  and utilities have been pre-installed:
  <ul>
    <li> Editors: vim, gvim, nvim, emacs, nano, geany, kate, gedit </li>
    <li> IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA Community, PyCharm Community, Visual Studio Code </li>
    <li> Compilers: g++, pypy3 </li>
    <li> gdb </li>
  </ul>
  You may also use the host operating system (Windows 10) if you prefer, but we can't guarantee
  the availability of any particular program.
</p>

<p>
  We allow onsite teams to use their own computer instead. In particular, if you rely on very
  specific IDEs, we encourage you to bring your own computer. Keep in mind though that the rule
  about using only one computer still applies.
</p>

<p>
  Onsite teams will have access to a printer.
</p>

<h3>Universal Cup mirrors</h3>
<p>
  Two of our contests will be mirrored as <a href="https://ucup.ac/">Universal Cup</a> stages.
  If you are a camp participant, please do not participate in the Universal Cup stages on 18th
  and 25th February; or if you do, please do not participate in the corresponding contests in the camp.
</p>

<p>
  If you would like your participation in the camp to contribute to your Universal Cup rating,
  contact us and mention your Universal Cup login name.
